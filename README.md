# Pre-work-study-guide

## A study guide for the prework modules for bootcamp

I created this study guide to have all my notes on HTML, CSS, Git, and Javascript all in one place. I wanted a site I can look at whenever I need and be able to go back in and add things as I learn more about each language. I learned the very basics of each language and jotting down notes can help me keep track of what I have learned.

## Usage

This guide is for use during class or for homework. It is especially going to be helpful at the beggining of the bootcamp so I don't have to look up Git codes as much. Also there are many descriptions of different functional elements for HTML, CSS, and Javascript. These descritions will help me by being a base of understanding into these three languages.
